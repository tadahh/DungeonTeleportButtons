# Dungeon Teleport Buttons

Makes Mythic+ dungeon icons clickable to cast their teleport spells.

## Overview

Dungeon Teleport Buttons enhances the **Mythic+ Dungeons UI** by turning each dungeon icon into a fully functional **teleport button**.  
If you know the teleport spell for that dungeon, you can cast it directly by clicking the icon—no macros, spell book searching, or extra setup required.

The addon also updates tooltips to show:

*   **Ready** — teleport is available
*   **On cooldown** — displays remaining cooldown
*   **Not learned** — teleport spell not yet unlocked

### Original WeakAura by Mend-Frostmourne

This addon is based on the excellent WeakAura created by **Mend (Frostmourne)**.  
All credit goes to him for the idea and original implementation.

### Addon Conversion & Updates by Jugy-Mal'ganis

When the original WeakAura stopped working, I made and maintained my own updated version. With WeakAuras no longer supported, this addon continues the idea in a stable, standalone form.
